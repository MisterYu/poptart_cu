Prediction Of Pressure Through Acoustic Ray Tracing

CUDA tool to model attenuation and refraction of sound as it propagates through atmospheric layers.

TODO (in no particular order):

add non isotropic source

add freqeuncy bins (0.1Hz)

add doppler (rounded to 0.1Hz for easy indexing) to account for sound from moving source

calculate sound pressure level wrt time and frequency at given distance from moving source
